#### Quick Install

This guide aims to jump start the project settings and bring a fast hands-on DRF Project. However, to enable and run the project, some commands are still required.

- **Step 1** - Create a virtual python environment to install all required dependencies:
~~~
    python3 -m venv venv
~~~

- **Step 2** - Activate the virtual python environment:
~~~
    . venv/bin/activate
~~~

- **Step 3** - Install all dependencies:
~~~
    pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

- **Step 4** - Run internal server and fun! ;)
~~~
    python manage.py runserver
~~~

Stop the server typing Ctrl+C in terminal.
